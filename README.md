[Project C - Red-Black trees](./red_black_tree/)

### Description

Red-Black trees are a type of `self-balancing binary search tree`. They maintain balance during `insertions` and `deletions`, ensuring efficient `search`, `insertion`, and `deletion operations` with a logarithmic time complexity. Red-Black trees are often used in scenarios where a balanced tree structure is crucial, such as in certain `database implementations` and `memory allocation algorithms`.

[Project C - Graphs](./graphs/)

### Description

Graphs represent a collection of `nodes` and `edges`, where `nodes` represent entities, and `edges` define relationships between them. Graph algorithms involve exploring or manipulating these relationships. Common graph algorithms include depth-first search `(DFS)` and breadth-first search `(BFS)`. Graphs find applications in various fields, such as `social network analysis`, `route planning`, and `network optimization`.

[Project C - Huffman coding](./huffman_coding/)

### Description

Huffman coding is a `compression algorithm` that assigns variable-length codes to input `characters` based on their `frequencies`. Characters with higher frequencies receive `shorter codes`, resulting in more efficient `compression`. Huffman coding is widely used in `data compression applications`, including `file compression` and `image encoding`. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in achieving `compression with minimal loss of information`.
