### Pathfinding Overview:

Pathfinding is a technique used in computer science and artificial intelligence to find the shortest path or optimal route between two points within a graph or grid. It is commonly applied in various domains such as robotics, video games, network routing, and more.

### Backtracking:

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that involves trying out different paths recursively and undoing the choices if they do not lead to a solution. It is a brute-force approach and can be inefficient for certain problems, especially when the search space is large.

In the provided task, the goal is to implement a backtracking algorithm to find the first path from a starting point to a target point within a two-dimensional array.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm:

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It works well for finding the shortest path in a graph, but its main weakness is that it doesn't handle negative edge weights well, and it can become inefficient in the presence of a large number of nodes.

### A Algorithm:*

The A* (A-star) algorithm is an improvement over Dijkstra's algorithm, combining elements of both Dijkstra's and greedy best-first search. It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost from the current node to the target node and prioritizes nodes with lower total costs. A* is generally more efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm and is widely used in pathfinding applications.
